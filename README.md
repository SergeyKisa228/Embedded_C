# Projects for AVR and STM32

The repository contains firmware for microcontrollers **ATmega16A** (AVR) and **STM32F103C8T6** (Cortex-M3).

## AVR projects

-- LUMINAR_STIM_ACP
-- Digital_Thermometer

## STM32 projects

-- MultitaskingSystem_on_FreeRTOS
-- Voltmeter

## About projects
All projects are written in the C programming language. I tried to bring the code as close to MISRA-C as possible.
I developed projects for ATmega16A in Atmel Studio, and for STM32F10C8T6(Blue Pill) in STM32CUBEIDE.

## Each project can be viewed in detail separately. 
## The description file is located in the project folder
